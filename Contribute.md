# How to contribute to BTCPay?

The easiest way is to use the software as a business or individual, provide feedback and [report any bugs or issues](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues) you or your customers encounter.

Translating BTCPay, helping us with [documentation](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc/issues), making videos and spreading the word are ways in which you can help, even if you're not a developer or tech-savvy.

We need more VPS hosting providers to implement [1-Click BTCPay deployment](LunaNodeWebDeployment.md) and make the installation of software more accessible, decentralized and widely-available.

We are actively looking for developers who can take on and resolve GitHub issues and help with development. If you would like to help us, but need some guidance,  [#dev channel on Mattermost](https://chat.btcpayserver.org/btcpayserver/channels/dev) is the place to ask questions.
